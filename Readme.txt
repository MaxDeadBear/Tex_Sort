Disclaimer: TEX Sorter is an independent texture organization utility developed separately from and not officially affiliated with FCH823's and Wastelander121's  TFC Installer / PNG to DDS Converter tools. While TEX Sorter may share visual design similarities with these applications, it is a standalone program with its own distinct functionality. TEX Sorter specializes in automatically sorting texture files by their resolution and dimensions, making it easier to organize textures for upscaling workflows or size-based categorization. 

To use TEX Sorter, simply select your source folder containing the textures you wish to sort (subdirectories are supported), choose your desired output folder destination, and select whether to copy files (preserving originals) or move files directly (to conserve drive space). The program will then organize your textures into resolution-based folders for streamlined texture management.

Use at Your Own Risk: TEX Sorter is provided as-is without any warranties or guarantees. Users assume full responsibility for any data loss, file corruption, or system issues that may occur during use. Always backup your files before processing, especially when using the "move files" option. The developer is not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use of this software.
